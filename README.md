Worked through Sitepoint tutorial to practice a few things.

(reminders of what I practiced, etc)

1. Finished it all on my own practicing creating everything in cli (just to practice) and writing using vim. 

2. Of course, at the end of that step, nothing worked and I went to the original files to try to figure things out.

3. At the end of the day, I found the documentation regarding the deprecated stuff. I got confused and was tired and a little bit disheartened.

4. Went over to forked repos and found a recent one. Actually copy/pasted files to try to understand what needed to be updated better.

5. Feel like ^^ is cheating. But also realized that I was completely lost and tried my best to learn from what works...

6. It works!

7. And I was able to troubleshoot that for some reason, I had misunderstood the static file structure...and also I needed to reinstall the jquery modal file.

8. Hurray.
